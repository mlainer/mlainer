### Personal Weather Station
Since March 2016, I have been operating a personal weather station (Davis VANTAGE Pro 2) that collects real-time data. This project aims to provide valuable local weather information to the community and supports meteorological research.

You can check out the live weather data on the weather station's dedicated website: [la-wetter.noip.me](https://la-wetter.noip.me/).
